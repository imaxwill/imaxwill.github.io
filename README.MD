Welcome to my Home Repository!
---
***Information:***
<br>
This is where my JavaScript library `infinity.js` and website is hosted. Feel free to poke around, you may find something you didn't know you wanted!
<br><br>
***Finding Backups:***
<br>
Every time I update a project repository, a folder is created inside `/repo/<project_name>` which contains a copy of the update. This means you can look at early alpha builds of my code! *Then again, you probably just want a preferred version.*
<br><br>
***Compatibility Index:***
<br>
My other github projects make use of my JavaScript library. In each version folder, like the ones mentioned above, there is an `index.json` which contains useful information about that version, including what version of `infinity.js` it requires.

***Thanks For Reading...***
<br>
My goal with this github account is to provide tools that allow a more streamlined workflow when programming with NodeJS. I feel as if it is extremely complicated, especially for new users... let alone someone experienced like me!
